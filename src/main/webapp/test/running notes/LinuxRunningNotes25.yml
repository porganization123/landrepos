Linux Commands 1 :
=======================
PayPal   = Client 
========================
Computers = 
Operating system - OS
   80% Linux OS
   20% Windows OS
       Solaris OS
       Mac-OS 
   ''
  Ownership of data center
  Rent computing services  

We are leveraging computing serviceS from AWS and GCP

 Linus - 1991 


 Linux OS =

   Is an Open source OS = Free + code 

  WINDOWS --> Microsoft 
  Solaris --> Sun System


Linus was a student who converted a problem into a business
   
 Solaris wasn't an open source = paid for 

 Create a free Account in AWS =  

    https://aws.amazon.com/ 

CONNECTING TO LINUX SERVER IN AWS: 
      host: 
        PublicIP  = 3.233.222.45
           Access the server from external Networks
        privateIP = 172.31.8.197
           Access the server from internal Networks
      VPN
      authentication:
         SSH-key =  class25demo.pem  = pem file
         password = 
      
      users details:
      userName = ec2-user  
          = default user

      ssh-client Software :
      mobaXterm or puTTY 
Networking: 
  ssh ec2-user@3.233.222.45 = pasword 
  ssh landmark@3.233.222.45
  ssh -i class25demo.pem landmark@3.233.222.45
ssh -i "class25demo.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-233-222-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Managing Files, Folders and sub Folders
In Linux folders = Directories 
File structure in Linux :
                        /  
                           = root (Main)
                        c: drive for Windows
      /sbin /etc /tmp /lib   /home  /bin  /opt 

home  = users
===========
 - ec2-user
 - simon 
 - landmark  
 - olu 
 - ade

bin = binary files or commands 
=============================
- cd    = change Directory
- ls    = list files and Directory
- cat   = displays the content of a file
- pwd   = present working directory
- whoami

sbin = system bin
=================
- adduser simon
- useradd landmark
- passwd simon
- init 0
users with elevated priviledges
What is the difference between bin and sbin in Linux? 
 sbin are binary flies only executable by users 
   with admin/elevated priviledges 
 bin files are executable by any user 


  CREATE FILES OR FOLDERS (Directory) 
    key.pem 
    test.txt 
    deploy.yml 
    hello.py 
    monitor.sh 
    ec2.tf
    hello.java
    pom.xml


LINUX SERVER = default files and directories  

etc = configuration files
======================== 
  - /etc/passwd 
  - /etc/shadow 
  - /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

tmp - temporal file holder 
=========================

opt = Install Softwares and Packages
===
 - maven 
 - tommcat 

lib  = 
====

proc 
=======
-  meminfo 
-  cpuinfo 

========================
      ls /bin 
      ls /sbin 
      ls /tmp 
      ls /opt 
      ls /var
      ls /lib 
      ls /etc 
sudo is use to escalate or elevate priviledges
Linux Basic Commands:
=====================
  mkdir  = create directory     
  ls = list fil and directories 
  mkdir class25
  mkdir devops
  mkdir -v test 
        -v verbose
        -p create both parent and child directories 
textmate
mkdir -pv Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/Nexus/

  mkdir  Devops/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/
  mkdir  Devops/SDLC/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/Nexus/

 tree 
 yum install tree

Linux is case sensitive  = 
   test / Test / TEST are different files in Linux

  mkdir -p  devops/Linux/Jenkins/Git/Maven/Nexus/

      mkdir -v test/ebay

 = tree cannot be found 

 = yum install tree  -- permission denied 

 sudo yum install tree

classes users:
    Normal users 
      sudo adduser ade
      sudo su - ade 
    Root / superuser / admin 
    system users  

rmdir it is use to delete empty directories

mkdir use to create directories 

rm -r use to delete directories 

commands in Linux are in lower case
